lol
to choose what file to unlock, edit the file and scroll to the bottom.
you should see ":Bye"
under ":Bye" it says start saved.bat
change saved.bat to your file or website url and save.
now open and solve the puzzle to unlock your file.
(Your file is not locked, jut hidden. it does not permanently lock you out.)
it was too hard to make a word guessing game so i used numbers 1 to 100.
